# Lab: Retry and Idempotency

## Goal
Prove retry behavior and deterministic idempotency keys.

## Commands
```bash
npm run agentic:test
```

## Expected output
- Retry and idempotency tests pass.

## Mutation exercise
- Change max attempts in retry logic and observe behavior.

## Observation prompt
- Note what changed after your mutation and why the system responded that way.

## Failure injection drill
- Simulate permanent error code and ensure retries stop.

## Pass/fail evidence artifact
- Save test output as reliability artifact.
