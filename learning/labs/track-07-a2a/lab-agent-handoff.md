# Lab: A2A Handoff Contract

## Goal
Create a two-agent handoff payload and validate schema.

## Commands
```bash
node scripts/dashboard/mock-a2a-handoff.mjs
```

## Expected output
- Valid payload accepted, invalid payload rejected.

## Mutation exercise
- Remove required field and confirm rejection.

## Observation prompt
- Note what changed after your mutation and why the system responded that way.

## Failure injection drill
- Simulate timeout and trigger retry path.

## Pass/fail evidence artifact
- Store accepted/rejected payload logs.
