# Lab: ROI and Expected Value Gating

## Goal
Validate cost-per-success and ROI computation logic.

## Commands
```bash
npm run agentic:test
```

## Expected output
- ROI tests pass with deterministic formulas.

## Mutation exercise
- Change total cost and validate ROI impact.

## Observation prompt
- Note what changed after your mutation and why the system responded that way.

## Failure injection drill
- Set expected value below threshold and verify route-to-human.

## Pass/fail evidence artifact
- Save ROI test output.
