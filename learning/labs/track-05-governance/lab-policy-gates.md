# Lab: Policy Gate Decisions

## Goal
Validate allow/deny/approval/human-route outcomes.

## Commands
```bash
npm run agentic:test
```

## Expected output
- Policy engine tests pass for budget breach and high-risk approval.

## Mutation exercise
- Change budget cap and observe route changes.

## Observation prompt
- Note what changed after your mutation and why the system responded that way.

## Failure injection drill
- Request blocked tool and verify deny path.

## Pass/fail evidence artifact
- Store policy decision logs as artifacts.
